# CSPMigration
My name is Tyler Fleming, and I am an IT Consultant. My company has recently become a Microsoft CSP, and because of this I have been running into a lot of Azure Migrations, specifically moving resources from their Current Azure Subscription to our CSP Subscription.

I am relatively new to Powershell, and I can see this becoming a huge project. I am pretty excited to begin working on this.

What is currently supported to be moved in Azure:
